# Contributing to BloomTrip

Thanks for your interest in contributing! ðŸŽ‰

## Ways to Help
- Bug reports
- Feature proposals
- Improving docs / diagrams
- Adding tests

## Development Flow (Initial Draft)
1. Fork & branch: `feat/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`
2. Keep commits small & meaningful
3. Run formatting / linting (to be defined)
4. Open a PR with clear context (problem, approach, tradeâ€‘offs)

## Commit Message Convention (Suggested)
Format: `<type>(optional scope): <short summary>`
Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`.

## Code Style
Will be formalized once tech stack is locked. Until then: prefer clarity over cleverness.

## Testing
Place tests in `tests/` mirroring source/service structure.

## Reporting Bugs
Open an issue with:
- Description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual
- Environment (versions)

## Proposing Features
Explain:
- Problem / motivation
- Proposed solution
- Alternatives considered
- Potential impact

## Security
If you discover a security issue, please DO NOT open a public issue yet. (Private disclosure process to be defined.)

## License
By contributing you agree that your contributions are licensed under the repository's license.
