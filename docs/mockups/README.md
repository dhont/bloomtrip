# Mockups

Early UX visuals illustrating key user flows. Assets will evolve; filenames remain stable for docs links.

| Screen | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `dashboard.png` | User landing / recent trips / recommendations | Personalization tiles fed by cached retrieval sets. |
| `trip_builder.png` | Interactive itinerary assembly | Inline RAG suggestions per day slot. |
| `on_trip_mode.png` | Mobile live trip view | Offline caching, day progress, context-aware suggestions. |

Design Principles:

1. Fast clarity.
2. Grounded transparency (attribution + source icons).
3. Progressive disclosure (advanced filters tucked away).
4. Trust & compliance (clear licensing/usage indicators).

Roadmap (Design):

- Add lowâ€‘fidelity wireframes
- Incorporate usability feedback sessions
- Add dark mode variants
