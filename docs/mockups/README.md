# Mockups

These image placeholders represent upcoming UI surfaces. Replace each PNG with exported design artifacts (Figma or Excalidraw) keeping the same filenames.

| Screen | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `dashboard.png` | User landing / recent trips / recommendations | Personalization tiles fed by cached retrieval sets. |
| `trip_builder.png` | Interactive itinerary assembly | Inline RAG suggestions per day slot. |
| `on_trip_mode.png` | Mobile live trip view | Offline caching, day progress, context-aware suggestions. |

Design Principles:

1. Fast clarity: show actionable next steps.
2. Grounded transparency: attribution + source icons.
3. Progressive disclosure: advanced filters tucked away.
4. Trust & compliance: clear licensing/usage indicators.

Next Steps:

- Add lowâ€‘fidelity wireframes.
- Iterate with usability feedback.
- Add dark mode variants.
