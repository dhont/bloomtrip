## Feedback Anchors (App Instrumentation)

* Trip card group ID: `wknd_2025_09_13_RO_Bucharest_outdoor_mix`  
* Each segment (Forest Loop, Snagov Lakeside, Sinaia Loop) gets independent Save / Boost / Mute telemetry.

---
## Source Hints (Would Be Cited In-App)

* Local MTB forum trail thread (Băneasa conditions)
* Public recreation dataset (Snagov amenities)
* Weather API (forecast snapshot at generation time)
* User profile embeddings (interests: e‑bike, nature, camper)

---
## UI Representation (Concept)
Each section is a “Trip Card” component:  
`<TripCard title="Băneasa Forest Loop" distance="25 km" difficulty="Easy‑Moderate" badges={['E‑Bike','Forest','Shaded']} rationale="Matches your e‑bike + forest preferences and current mild temperature window." />`

Interactive actions per card: [Save] [Boost Similar] [Mute] [Swap] [Explain]
