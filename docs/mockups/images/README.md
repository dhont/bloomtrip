# Mockup Images

Place exported PNG/JPEG mockup files here. Referenced by markdown docs.

Expected filenames (add real images with these names):
- search-refinement-screen.png
- itinerary-map-page.png
- divergent-results-mobile.png
- itinerary-day-detail.png

After adding binary images, MkDocs will include them automatically; ensure relative paths in markdown: `![Alt text](images/filename.png)`.
