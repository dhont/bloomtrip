# Architecture Overview (Stub)

This section will consolidate system context, component boundaries, deployment topology, and data flows.

Planned pages:

- context_diagram.md
- component_breakdown.md
- deployment_topology.md
- data_flow_rag.md
- caching_strategy.md
- security_compliance.md

Existing legacy architecture content will be migrated here and normalized.
