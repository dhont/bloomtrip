# Architecture Overview (Stub)

This section consolidates canonical architecture documentation: system context, components, deployment topology, data flow, caching, and security.

Pages:

- System Context Diagram: context_diagram.md
- Component Breakdown: component_breakdown.md
- Deployment Topology: deployment_topology.md
- RAG Data Flow: data_flow_rag.md
- Caching Strategy: caching_strategy.md
- Security & Compliance: security_compliance.md

Legacy pages under `architecture/` remain temporarily (deprecated) for backlink continuity.
