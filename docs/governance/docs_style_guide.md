# Documentation Style Guide (Draft)

Principles:

1. Audience first: specify audience at top when not obvious.
2. Prefer short declarative sentences.
3. Use present tense for system behavior.
4. Provide rationale when recommending a pattern.
5. One concept per heading section.

Formatting:

- Headings: sentence case (capitalize first word only unless proper noun)
- Tables: include header row and align pipes
- Admonitions: Use `Note`, `Warning`, `Tip` appropriately

Required Sections (when applicable): Context, Decision, Consequences (for ADRs); Overview, Steps, References (for runbooks).
