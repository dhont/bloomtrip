# ADR-0001: Initialize Architecture Decision Record Process

Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-09-05

## Context
We need a lightweight, transparent method to document architectural and product-enabling decisions as the project scales. Without a consistent pattern, rationale is lost and onboarding slows.

## Decision
Adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) stored in `docs/governance/adrs/` using sequential numbering (zero-padded to 4 digits). Each ADR file name: `ADR-<number>-<kebab-title>.md`.

Template sections: Title, Status, Date, Context, Decision, Consequences, References (optional). Status lifecycle: Proposed → Accepted → (Deprecated|Superseded).

## Consequences
+ Improves traceability and onboarding.
+ Encourages deliberate decision making.
+ Minimal overhead (Markdown only).
- Requires discipline to keep statuses current.
