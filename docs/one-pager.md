# BloomTrip One-Pager

**Tagline:** *Where your weekends come alive.*

---
## Problem

Planning short (2–4 day) getaways is time-consuming. People juggle weather forecasts, event calendars, blogs, Reddit threads, and outdated listicles—still ending up with generic, mistimed, or impractical suggestions.

---
 
## Solution

BloomTrip is a **weekend-first** travel app that delivers **personalized trip suggestions** based on your profile, **live weather**, **seasonal & local events**, and **social buzz**. A grounded RAG pipeline produces explainable, source‑cited trip cards so users know *why* each idea fits them right now.

## Market Opportunity

- Rising interest in campervan / e‑bike / nature micro-adventures
