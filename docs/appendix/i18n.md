# Internationalization Strategy (Draft)

Phases:
1. Content audit for locale-sensitive strings.
2. Externalize UI & system messages.
3. Source language freeze + glossary finalization.
4. Machine translation bootstrap + human review for priority locales.
5. Continuous translation pipeline (PR triggers extraction).

Risks:
- Prompt performance variability across languages.
- Token cost growth.

Mitigations:
- Evaluate language-specific embedding models.
- Cache translated system prompts.
